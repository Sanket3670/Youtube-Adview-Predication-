# Youtube-Adview-Predication-
The YouTube Adview Prediction project focuses on forecasting the number of ad views a video is likely to receive based on various features. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze patterns in historical data and predict future outcomes, aiding content creators, advertisers, and platform managers in understanding video performance and optimizing campaigns.

How It Works
1. Problem Definition
The task is a regression problem, where the target variable is the number of ad views a video garners.
The objective is to predict this value based on features like video metadata, category, duration, comments, and more.
2. Dataset
-The dataset typically contains the following attributes:
-Video Metadata: Title, description, tags, category, and upload date.
-Engagement Metrics: Number of likes, dislikes, comments, and shares.
-Video Features: Duration, resolution, and video quality.
-Ad Performance: Historical data on views, click-through rates, etc.

3.Data Preprocessing Steps:
-Handling missing values (e.g., using mean/mode imputation or dropping irrelevant columns).
-Encoding categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding for video categories).
-Scaling numerical features for better model performance.
-Removing outliers to avoid skewing the model.
4.Feature Engineering
Derive new features, such as:
-Engagement ratio: (likes + comments) / views.
-Ad-to-view ratio: ad views / total views.
-Temporal trends: Time of upload, seasonal trends, etc.

5.Machine Learning Algorithms Used:
-Linear Regression: To establish baseline performance.
-Random Forest Regressor: For handling non-linear relationships and feature interactions.
-Gradient Boosting Models (XGBoost, LightGBM, or CatBoost): For high accuracy in predictions.
-Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): To capture complex patterns in the data.
-Advanced Concepts in ANN Architecture:

6.Multiple layers with ReLU activation for hidden layers.
-Batch Normalization to stabilize training.
-Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
-Optimizers like Adam or RMSprop for efficient training.
-Model Evaluation
-Metrics for regression problems:
-Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures average absolute prediction errors.
-Mean Squared Error (MSE): Highlights larger errors more significantly.
-RÂ² Score: Evaluates how well the model explains the variance in the data.
-Perform cross-validation to ensure robustness and avoid overfitting.
